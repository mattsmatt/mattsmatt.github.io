                Currently, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science in Bina Nusantara University. I am in my third year, 5th semester specifically, and I am taking the Software Engineering streaming program. I enjoy problem-solving while working with people in a team environment. I am a fast learner and I am competent in working under pressure.</p>

                <p>Right now, I am exploring JavaFX and integrating Java with MySQL. I am familiar in HTML, CSS, Java, Python, C, ASP.NET and C#. I am also capable of database querying using MySQL and UI/UX design with Figma.</p>
